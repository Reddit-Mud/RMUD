Lantern Room and Balcony

The huge [lantern] sits unused, yet its mirrors and prisms are clean and in excellent condition, indicating 
that someone still cares for this lighthouse, despite it's heart no longer beating. It sits as a guardian
monument, ever watching the waters for passing ships, waiting to be revived for nostalgic ceremony. A vast 
swath of the ocean is visable from up here, as is most of the island. There is a quaint, smartly kept
residence to the north, and a small town beyond that, yet the expanse of open sea tugs at your attentions,
offering infinite possibilities with open arms.

Down - Stairwell

lantern - it sits on a pedestal with a variety of strangely shaped prisms. There is writing on the base
          but you are unable to read it. It looks as though the glyphs were scratched into the metal
          housing. The lamp inside the glass resembles a cat's iris.
