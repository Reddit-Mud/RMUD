// So this is an interesting method I've wanted to try for a while: A tutorial that is, itself,
// source. I want to give an example of how to write a new command. It's a complex topic, but
// there are a ton of examples already in the project.

// In this case, we'll create a command to push things between rooms. This is a fairly obscure
// action that doesn't have many uses, but crops up now and then and manages to still be built
// into Inform7. 

// Comments are supposed to commentary. If they were supposed to be documentation, they would be
// called documents. So that's what we'll have here: A lot of commentary.

// First, boiler plate nonsense.
